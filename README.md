## Introduction

Pinterest crunches billions of data points every day to decide how to provide more value to their users. In this project, a similar system is created using the AWS Cloud.

The key tools in this project include:

- AWS EC2: to create an EC2 instance.
- AWS IAM: to use an authorised IAM user on the EC2 instance.
- AWS MSK: to manage the cluster.

In this project, we learn:

1. How to connect to AWS
2. How to configure a EC2 Kafka client using an EC2 instance, an authorised IAM user, and MSK to manage the cluster.
3. The list will grow as I develop the project!
